# Unity-Music-Trivia-Board

This repo contains the editor and project config for a Unity template object, you will need to download and install Unity and open the project to use it. I used Unity 2020.3.11 but most modern LTS versions should be fine. 

Download Unity [here](https://unity.com/download)

## Instructions:

On this page, right next to the about section and above the number of commits; you should see a green button labeled: 'Code'. 
Click on that and download the zip of this repo. Once downloaded make an extra root folder(new folder for the zip extraction) and extract it. 

From there you can open the project in two ways:
- If the unity hub came with your install;
  - Go into the 'projects' tab and hit 'add'. Then select the project folder inside the root. 
- If you just have an install of Unity
  - Select the project from it's startup or inside the editor; go to File > Open Project.

When opening it for the first time you'll need to wait a minute or two as Unity needs to rebuild it's libraries, since they regen anyway and take too much space on the repo (akin to node modules).
